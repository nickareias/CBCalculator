# cbway Calculator Test

## Some notes about my solution

- Changed the .css file to .scss because it was written in sass. I used the sass pre-processor to convert the .scss file to .css
- Added "pointer-events: none" to the number pop-up animation because it was blocking the cursor styling of buttons after it dissapeared.
- I used the concept of significant digits for dealing with decimals; The calculator shows as many decimal digits as there have been in the longest number in the current equation. This helps to ignore some problems with floating point precision, and helps to format decimals cleanly.

#### Thanks for taking the time to look over my solution to this problem!
