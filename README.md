# cbway Calculator Test

You will have 4 days to complete this test. Please fork over and when submitting to your recruiter attach a link to your own github. If you are not able to complete, finish as much as you can as the point of this test is to see your solution, whether it is complete or not. If you have any questions during the test, please submit them promptly to your recruiter. We will get to as many questions as possible during the timeframe. None of the code you write will be used for production/testing purposes, this is simply a test to gauge where your core JavaScript skills lie.

Thanks and GOOD LUCK!!
